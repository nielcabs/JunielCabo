Hi there ✌️ nice to meet you! I'm a _Fullstack Developer_ at [City College of Angeles](#) based out of Phillipines, Pampanga.

I'm an aspiring Software Engineer with a passion for writing code and making things on the web look pretty. I'm well acquainted with various *Web Development* & *Mobile App Development* as well as *frontend*, *backend*, *database* and *blockchains*. I have always been a firm believer in the human element of design and knowing your audience. Therefore, I strive to create simple, functional and impactful user experiences.  I primarily code in **ReactJS** and **JavaScript**, and use **Canva** and **Adobe XD** for designing.

In my free time, I love to play basketball, cook, play the online games, explore neighborhoods through food and occasionally bring out my inner photographer. Also, did someone say Shot na?
